# Student-Management-System
A C++ console-based student management system using OOP and STL.

# 🎓 Student Management System — C++ OOP Project

This is a beginner-level project demonstrating:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++
- Use of STL `vector`, iterators, and sorting
- Modular code structure using `.h` and `.cpp` files
- Console interaction with proper formatting

## 🚀 Features
- Add, display, update, and delete student records
- Update specific fields (GPA, department, phone, email)
- Sort students by GPA using operator overloading
- Safe input and empty-list validation

## 📚 Technologies Used
- C++
- OOP (Encapsulation, abstraction)
- STL (vector, iterator)
- Operator overloading

## 📂 Files
- `Student.h` — class definition
- `Student.cpp` — class implementation
- `main.cpp` — user interface and menu logic
